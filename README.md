The ReadMe is usually the first document people will see of your project. Depending on your project it should give a **short** introduction and usage/build examples. It **should only contain the information you expect users to read**. It is usually possible to link to other documentation files using the **markdown syntax** which gets rendered as html by popular repository hosting platforms.
