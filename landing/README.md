# TruLedgr Landing Page

Landing page for TruLedgr financial management platform (currently in development).

This is a Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite application showcasing the upcoming TruLedgr platform.

## ⚠️ Development Status

TruLedgr is currently in active development. This landing page represents planned features and functionality that will be available upon launch.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
