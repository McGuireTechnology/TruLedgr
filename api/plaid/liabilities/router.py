Plaid Liabilities Router - Official Implementation

Comprehensive router for credit cards, mortgages, and student loans with proper authentication.
All endpoints require user authentication and follow REST conventions.

This router has been completely rebuilt to provide:
- Comprehensive liability data storage and retrieval
- Support for credit cards, mortgages, and student loans
- Real-time sync capabilities with Plaid API
- Detailed APR, payment, and servicer information
- Webhook event processing for data updates
