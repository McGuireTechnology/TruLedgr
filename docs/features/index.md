## What Makes TruLedgr Different

### :material-calendar-month: Monthly Cycle Design

Unlike other apps that focus on annual budgets, TruLedgr is built around **monthly financial cycles** - the way most people actually manage money:

- Monthly paychecks
- Monthly bills and subscriptions
- Monthly budget reviews
- Month-over-month comparisons

### :material-currency-usd: Proper Money Handling

TruLedgr uses decimal precision for all monetary calculations - no floating-point rounding errors that can lose pennies. Your balances are always accurate to the cent.

### :material-shield-check: Privacy & Security

- **Bank-level encryption** for all data
- **OAuth2 authentication** - no passwords stored
- **Self-hosting option** - keep your data on your own server
- **No data selling** - your information is never shared or monetized

### :material-sitemap: Complete Financial Picture

Go beyond simple budgeting:

- Track net worth over time
- Plan your estate distribution
- Optimize tax deductions
- Set and achieve financial goals
- Prepare for major life events
