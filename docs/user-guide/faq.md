## üí∞ Using TruLedgr

### How do I add transactions?

Click the "Add Transaction" button on your dashboard, fill in the amount, description, and category, then save. You can also bulk import transactions from a CSV file.

### Can I edit or delete transactions?

Yes! Click on any transaction to edit its details or delete it. Be careful with deletions as they cannot be undone.

### What types of transactions can I track?

- **Expenses**: Money you spend (groceries, rent, entertainment)
- **Income**: Money you receive (salary, freelance, gifts)  
- **Transfers**: Moving money between your own accounts

### How do categories work?

Categories help organize your spending (Food, Transportation, Housing, etc.). TruLedgr comes with common categories, but you can create custom ones that match your lifestyle.

### Can I change transaction categories?

Yes! Click on any transaction and select a different category. You can also set up rules to automatically categorize similar transactions in the future.

### What if I make a mistake?

No problem! You can edit any transaction details, including amount, description, category, and date. Just click on the transaction to modify it.

## üìä Budgets and Analytics

### How do budgets work?

Budgets set spending limits for categories (like $500/month for groceries). TruLedgr tracks your actual spending against these limits and shows progress bars.

### What happens if I go over budget?

Nothing bad! TruLedgr will show you're over budget with visual indicators, but it's just information to help you make better financial decisions.

### Can I have multiple budgets?

Yes! Create separate budgets for different categories, time periods (weekly/monthly), or even different family members.

### How do I see spending patterns?

Go to the Reports section to see charts and analytics showing:
- Spending by category (pie charts)
- Spending trends over time (line graphs)
- Budget vs. actual comparisons
- Monthly and yearly summaries

### Can I export my data?

Yes! Go to Settings ‚Üí Data Management ‚Üí Export to download your transactions as a CSV file that works with Excel or other spreadsheet programs.

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Family and Sharing

### Can my family use TruLedgr together?

Yes! Create a household and invite family members. Each person can have their own account while sharing budgets and viewing combined reports.

### How does family sharing work?

Each family member has their own login but can contribute to shared budgets and view household financial reports. You control who can see what information.

### Can children use TruLedgr?

TruLedgr is designed for adults managing their finances. For families with teenagers, parents can create accounts and teach financial responsibility through supervised usage.

### What if my spouse and I want separate finances?

No problem! You can keep individual accounts completely separate, or create a household for shared expenses (like groceries and rent) while maintaining personal spending categories.

## üîí Security and Privacy

### Is my financial data secure?

Yes! TruLedgr uses industry-standard encryption, secure authentication, and never stores sensitive banking information like account numbers or passwords.

### Does TruLedgr connect to my bank?

Currently, no. You manually enter transactions, which gives you complete control over your data and eliminates security risks from bank connections.

### Who can see my financial information?

Only you (and family members you explicitly invite to your household). TruLedgr never shares, sells, or analyzes your personal financial data.

### What if I forget my password?

Use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page to reset your password via email. We also recommend enabling two-factor authentication for extra security.

### Can I delete my account?

Yes! Go to Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Delete Account. This permanently removes all your data from our servers and cannot be undone.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Transactions aren't saving

Check these common issues:
- Make sure you're connected to the internet
- Verify all required fields (amount, description, category) are filled
- Try refreshing your browser and re-entering the transaction
- Clear your browser cache if problems persist

### I can't find a transaction

Try these steps:
- Check all date filters - transactions might be outside your current view
- Search by description or amount
- Verify you're looking in the right category
- Check if it was accidentally deleted (see recently deleted if available)

### Budget numbers look wrong

Possible causes:
- Check the budget date range (weekly vs. monthly)
- Verify transactions are categorized correctly
- Make sure you're viewing the right time period
- Confirm there are no duplicate transactions

### The website is slow or not loading

Try these solutions:
- Check your internet connection
- Try a different browser or incognito/private mode
- Clear your browser cache and cookies
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Contact support if issues persist

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

### How often should I add transactions?

Daily entry works best! Add transactions right after they happen, or set aside a few minutes each evening to catch up.

### What's the best way to organize categories?

Start simple with broad categories, then get more specific as needed. Use consistent naming and don't create too many categories initially.

### How much detail should I include?

Include enough detail to remember what the transaction was for, but don't overthink it. "Grocery shopping at Safeway" is better than just "food" or a lengthy description.

### Should I track cash transactions?

Yes! Cash spending can be significant and often gets overlooked. Add cash transactions as soon as possible so you don't forget.

### How do I stay motivated to track expenses?

- Start with small, achievable goals
- Review your progress weekly
- Celebrate when you stay under budget
- Focus on one category at a time
- Remember that even small improvements add up

## üéØ Advanced Usage

### Can I set up automatic transactions?

Recurring transaction templates are planned for future updates. Currently, you'll need to add recurring transactions (like rent or subscriptions) manually each month.

### How do I handle split transactions?

For expenses shared across categories (like a shopping trip with both groceries and household items), create separate transactions for each category portion.

### Can I track multiple bank accounts?

While TruLedgr doesn't connect to banks directly, you can add account information to transactions and use categories or tags to track different accounts.

### How do I handle cash back and refunds?

- **Cash back**: Add as a separate income transaction
- **Refunds**: Add as a negative expense or positive income transaction
- **Returns**: Edit the original transaction or add a counter-transaction

### What about investment tracking?

Investment tracking is planned for future updates. Currently, focus on cash flow (income and expenses) rather than investment portfolio values.
